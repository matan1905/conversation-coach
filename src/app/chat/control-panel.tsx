import React from 'react';

function ControlPanel() {
    return (
        <div className={"w-1/4"}>
            <p>
                This will be where I can get all sorts of chat settings.
                for example:
                    "Some one that finds everything you say creepy"
                    "someone that barely talks"
                    "someone that will answer only when they have no choice"
                this panel will also be used to do gamification, rate different settings and scenarios, restart chat and more
                also things like information that could be valuable about the chat persona.
            </p>
        </div>
    );
}

export default ControlPanel;
